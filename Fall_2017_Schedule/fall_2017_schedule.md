<p class=footertext2> This weekly workshop highlights the work of those pioneering data science analytical techniques and social science and computation methods while bringing together graduate students, post-docs, and faculty all working at the nexus of computation and big, social science questions. The workshop also allows regular participants to share works in progress for feedback, fosters robust dialogue between young scholars in these emerging fields, and showcases local scholars leading pedagogical seminars on new papers or methods. </p>

<p class=footertext2> The 2017-2018 <a href="https://macss.uchicago.edu/content/computation-workshop"> Computation Workshop </a> meets each Thursday from 11:00 a.m. to 12:20 p.m. in Rosenwald 015. All interested faculty and graduate students are welcome. Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a comment on the <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop/README"> issues page </a> of the <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop"> workshop's public repository on GitHub.</a></p>
